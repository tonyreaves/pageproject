        Capybaras are the best animals ever. They're basically huge guinea pigs, but you don't have to be into guinea pigs to appreciate them.</p>
        <p>Here are some reasons capybaras are the best:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Capybaras are chill af. Birds and monkeys ride them and they don't even care.</li>
            <li>That's pretty much it. They're kind of cute, but not especially so.</li>
            <li>I guess I only had one thing I like about them. Still, they'd probably make a good pet.</li>
            
        </ul>
